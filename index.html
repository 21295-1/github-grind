            <p>Composers are musicians who write(or compose) music. Composers are extremely common in the music industry, but they are also vital to the film industry.<br>
            Many iconic films would not be the same without composers. Be it legendary westerns like the Good, The Bad, and the Ugly, or iconic horror slashers like Halloween, film composers are capable of elevating the quality of a film the next level.<br>
            This list is dedicated to some of the best film composers of all time.
